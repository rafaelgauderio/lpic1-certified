-> 103.5. CREATE, MONITOR AND TERMINATE PROCESSES

		ps, top, uptime, free

	# ps 					report a snapshot of the current processes.
							display information about a selection of the active processes.
	# ps -ef 				-e = select all processes. Identifical to -A, -f = full format list
							PID = processes id, UID = user id, PPID = parent pid id
							/sbin/init = PID = 1
	# ps -ef | grep bash
	# bash
	# ps -ef | grep bash 	has the PPID, second bash emerged from the first PID
	# pa -axu				-ax = list all process, slecet bu effective user ID or name
	# pstree 				processes in a tree view
	# pstree -p 			show the corresponding PID
	# top 					Dynamic overwiew of the running processes.
							See the processes that are using a lot of system resources
	# uptime 				show load average, how long the system has been running
						  	0 = full system is used, higher the value, more the system is used
						  	The value should not be higher than the number of CPU course
							tasks = running, sleeping, stopped, zombie
	# ps -ef | nginx 		show PID 685 and PID 686
	# top -p 685,686  		show in top only nginx processes
							hot key t=sort by time, h=help and see individual hotkeys
	# free 					show the main memory and swap memory in details (total,free, used)
							-m = megabytes, -g = gigabytes, -h=humam readable

		pggrep, kill

	# pgrep					look up or signal processes bases on name and other atributes
							looks through the currentky running processes and list the process IDs which match the selection
										criteria to stdout
	# pkill == pgrep
	# pgrep ngnix 			685, 686 = PID
	# pgrep -l ngnix		list the name of the processes
	# kill 					shutdown signal to the processes
	# kill -l 				show the posible segments = 64 =
							1=SIGUP, 2=SIGIN, 3=SIGQUIT, 9=SIGKILL=kill hard, 15=SIGTERM=STANDARD SIGNAL=kill soft
	# kill signal pid
	# sudo kill -SIGTERM 685,686 			kill ngnix processes in a orderlu manner.
	# sudo systemctl start nginx
	# pgrep -l nginx 						8257, 8258 = PIDs
	# sudo kill -15 8257,8258
	# sudo kill -TERM 8315 					can omitted the word sig. -TERM = -SIGTERM
	# sudo kill 8322 						use SIGTERM by default if no option is inform
	# sudo kill -SIGSTOP 8343 				sleep the process, do not kill
	# sudo KILL -SIGCONT 8343 				signal continue

		pkill, killall

	# pkill 					look uo or signal process based on NAME and other atributes
	# killall 					kill processes by name
	# pkill -SIGNAL name
	# sudo pkill -x nginx 		-x = only kill the program with the exact name
	# killall -l 				display all the signals that killall understands

	# ps -fu rafael 			all processes that are running by user rafael
	# sydo killall -u rafael 	kill all the processes that belong to the user rafael

		nohup, screen, tmux
