	# cp -r /tmp . 						recursive. Copy the complete directory /tmp to the current directory
	# mv 								move or rename files. source file is deleted
	# touch 							change file timestamps, create files also. timestamps also change when we change the
											file, mas do not change when the file is just open or check it out

											F = differentiate files and directories, it will append / to directory entries
	# mkdir 							make directory, -p --parents, -v --verbose
	# mkdir test1 test2 test3 			create several directories at the same time

	# rmdir -p test5/test6/test7		-p --parents (delete sub folders also)
	# rm -r directory_name 				remove directories with files and subfolders 
	# rm -ivf file_name					-i --interactive, -v --verbose, -f --force
	# rm -rf / 							delete everything from root directory. This command is not allowed
	# rm -rf ./test1 					deletes the directory hete test1 ii the directory which we are current located
	# find 								search for files in a directory hierarchy

	# sudo find / -maxdepth 4 -name *.log 		search all in root directory with 3 maxdepth subfolders + 1 depth to the file
	# dd 								dislk dump. Use ti copy intire disk partitions or files bit by bit.
	# dd if=/dev/sda1 of=/dev/sdb1 	    if=input file, of=output file. Create a exact copy of the partition
	# dd if=file.txt of=file2.txt 		copy file bit by bit
				bs count 				bs = how big block should be, count = define how many blokcks
  	# sudo dd if=dev/sda1 of=backup_bootloarer bs=512 count=1
  	# tar 								archiving tool, abbreviation for tape archive. Pack, unpack several files together

  	# tar -tf file.tar 					display what files the archive contains
  	# tar -rf file.tar file3            add the file3 to the file.tar archive
  	# tar -cf file.tar ./* 				Pack all the files and subfolders from current directory in the file file.tar
  	# tar -xvf file2.tar 				x = extract que file tar, v=verbose, f=file
  	# tar -czvf file3.tar.gz file1 file.txt				z= gzip compression, choose always the extension .tar.gz
  	# tar -tzf file3.tar.gz             display que content of the compressed file with gzip
  	# tar -xzvf file3.tar.giz 			extrated the compressed file
  	# tar -cvjf file4.tar.bz2 file1 file.txt 			j= b2zip compressed	archive	
  	# tar -cvJf file4.tar.bz2 file1 file.txt 		    J= xz compressed archive	

  	# cpio -o 								copy in copy out. similar to tar. Can be compression or not. -o = copy-out
  	# cpio -i								copy files to and from archives and directories. -i = copy-in
  	# cpio -o, --create, -i --extract -p, --pass-through 
  	# ls | cpio -o > content.cpio.txt       copy the files in the packed file content.cpio.txt
  	# cpio -it < content.cpio.txt 			show the content of and unpacked content.cpio.txt file
  	# find . | cpio -o > packed.cpio 		find everything in the current folder and send to cpio int copy out mode
  	# find . | cpio -pd /tmp/test 			copy found files by copy pass mode. -d option ensures that /tmp/test directory
  													is create if doesnÂ´t already exits.
  	# find . | cpio -pd /tmp/text == cp -r * /tmp/test

  	# gzip file1 							create a compressed file file1.gz, original file is deleted after compressed
  	# gzip file1 file2 						compress the two file individually, not grouping. file1.gz file2.gz
 	# gzip -k file.txt 						-k --keep = do not delete input files during compressing or decompression
 	# gzip 									reduces the size of the named files using Lempel-ziv coding
 	# gzip -l --list, -q --quiet, -r --recursive, -c --stdout, -f --force, -k --keep, -d --decompress --uncompress
 	# gzip -dk file.txt.gz 					decompress and keep the compress file
 	# gunzip file35.gz 						decompress files, the same as using -d option

 	# bzip2 file1 							create a compress file1.bz2
 	# bzip2 -dk file1.bz2 					decompress file1.bz2
    # bunzip2 -dk file1.bz2 				the same as bzip2 -d

    # xz -k file1							create a compress file1.xz, -k --keep
    # xz -d file1.xz 						decompress file.xz

    # ls *.txt 								list all files with txt extention
    # ls test* 								list all files the start with test
    # ls text??								question mark, anu character, but one ? for each character
    # ls [tT]est*.csv 						Test.csv	test.csv	test1.csv	test45.csv
    # ls test[^1-2].txt 					test1.txt and test2.txt are excluded of the show list
