    101.2 

	-> Boot process

	    	BIOS -> Bootloader -> Kernel -> InitialRamDisk -> init(PID 1)

	    -> Bootloader = start the linux Kernel
	    	-> GRUB = Grand Unified BootLoader 
	    	-> LELO = Linux Loader
	    -> PID = Process ID	
	    -> As soon as PID 1 are started, the InitialRamDisk is no longer required

    # pstree -p 	= see all the process in tree structure, see PID
    # lxc image list
    # lxc launch ubuntu14		= container much faster than a virtual machine
    # lxc exec novel-pangolin -- bash
    # ps -ef 		= see the PID that are running

    # dmesg 		= print or control the kernel ring buffer
    				= see what happen during the boot
    # dmesg | grep -i error		= -i, no distinction is made between upper and lower case

    # journalctl 		= query the systemd journal = consulta o diario do systemd
    					= only work with systemd Linux distributions
    # journalctl -k 	= kernel

    	-> Current Bootloader = GRUB 2
    								-> comando line interface
    													-> rescue mode
    													-> edit mode
   	# shift		= display de menu bootloader during the boot
   				= press shift after the BIOS and hold it until the menu appears
   	# e 		= enter the edit mode, use to change certaun start parameters
   	# crtl + X  = start the system

   	----------------------
   	-> SysVinit 

   		-> PID 1	= First process tha started
   		-> All process originate from init
   	# System V init
   	# ls /sbin/init
   		-> init starts the relevant services one after one
   	# vi /etc/inittab
   		-> runlevel 	= states which Linux system operated, 7 diferent runlevels
   		-> runlevel 0	= switched off
   		-> runlevel 1	= single user mode
   		-> runlevel 2	= multi user, without NFS
   		-> runlevel 3	= network and multi user interface
   		-> runlevel 4	= unused
   		-> runlevel 5 	= default desktop system (network and graphical interface), X11
   		-> runlevel 6	= reboot (Do NOT set initdefault to this)
   	# init0				= switched off
   	# init6				= restarted	

   	# cd /etc/init.d 	
   	# cd /etc/rc.d
   	# cd /etc/rc.d/rc5.d
   		-> files with s = start
   		-> files with k = kill

   	# chkconfig --list	= see wicht processes are installed
   							 in the system and which runlevel they should be started
   	# /etc/init.d/ngnix status	= ngnix is stopped
   	# /etc/init.d/ngnix start
   	# service ngnix stop | start | restart | status


   	--------------------   	
   	-> upstart (outdated and hardly use)

   		-> Started all processes, one after other
   		-> Able to start process in parallel as long as these processes are independent
   		-> /etc/init 	= process here are started automatically
   	# cd etc/init
   		-> files.conf
   			-> ssh.conf, tty1.conf, resolvconf.conf, rsyslog.conf, udev.conf
   	# cd /sbin
   	# cat /sbin/init
   	# initctl list 		= display a list of all image jobs
   	# initctl status udev
   	# initctl start | stop | status udev

   	-------------------
   	-> systemd (Sucessor to upstart, default system nowdays)

   		-> starts interdependent processes in parallel, making the
   				system start a little faster
   	# cd /etc/systemd/sytem
   		-> system files that are call units
   	# cd /lib/systemd/system
   		-> if two unit with the same name are in both directories, then the units
   				in th /etc directory is preferred
   	# systemctl list-units		= display all units off the system
   	# sudo apt install ngnix
   	# systemctl status ngnix
   	# systemctl status | start | restart | stop ngnix

   	# vim /etc/systemd/system.conf 		= file of main configuration of systemd
