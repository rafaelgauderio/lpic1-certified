-> DIFFERENCE between container and virtual machine

	-> Contaniner is a lightwaight, isolated silo for runnig and application on the host operation system.
			Containers are bases on the host operation system kernel and contains only applications and some
			light operating systems APIs that run is a user mode.

	-> Virtual Machines run a complete operating system including the kernel it self.
