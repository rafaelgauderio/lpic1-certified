-> 104.6. Create and changing symbolic and hard links
	
	# ln file_name.txt link_name 				create hard link
									both files have the same content, hard link is a copy
									if the content of one file is changed, the other also is changed
									the only way to recognizes a hard link is bases on the inode
									can not do a hard link to one partitions to another

	# ln  							make links between files
	# ls -l 						see how manu links are from each file
	# ll 							see the directories links
	# ls -li 						check the inodes, equals inodes means hard links

		-> soft links == symbolic links, comparable to links on windows system
		-> if the original file is deleted, the soft link remains poiting to nothing
		-> can be recognize because have a different color, show with an arrow and a letter "l"

	# ln -s file_name.txt soft_link_name
	# ln -s --symbolic
